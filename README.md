## SQL Injection
After solving "Network sniffing" and "Web server login" we login at netsec-forum.dk using the credentials 

```Username = carsten@netsec.aau.dk and Password = mormor1932```

Afterwards we are directed to an "internal forum" with a message board we can interact with.

After poking a bit around in the input field, we discover the message board is vulnerable to SQL injection

...hm no flag yet. 
Our next objective now seems to be finding the flag in the SQL database we now have access to.
We now try looking for valid tables using a "SELECT ... FROM ..." query.
Because the webserver output detailed error messages, we can do this with trial and error

After a few tries we discover the table "users" and column "password".
In order to actually read the content visually, we use the concatenation operator `||` 
to concat the result from the SELECT query with our string being posted on the message board


... and voil√° we got the flag
